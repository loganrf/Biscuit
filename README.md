A board for prototyping basic RF circuits (filters etc).

Current design is only good to 1.8GHz. Work is underway to improve the end launch for better performance above that frequency.

Note the 4 extra SMA connectors on the edges. These can be enabled by using a knife to cut the center pad from the surrounding ground plane.
